The <a href=\"\" data-url-link=\"learn-capoeira\/15-basic-capoeira\">roda<\/a> consists of the orchestra and other capoeiristas. The orchestra and other capoeiristas, will sing and play the instruments. The <a href=\"\" data-url-link=\"learn-capoeira\/15-basic-capoeira\">berimbau<\/a> will usually be played by the highest ranked capoeirista in the roda.

Furthermore, if you are playing instruments, you may also rotate them with the other players in the orchestra. \r\n    <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        <strong>Entrance<\/strong> - There are two methods to enter the game:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n                The first method is to be handpicked by the <a href=\"\" data-url-link=\"learn-capoeira\/15-basic-capoeira\">Mestre.<\/a> Once you are chosen, both players kneel in front of the lead berimbau, shake hands and wait for the signal from the Mestre (through the song) to <a href=\"\" data-url-link=\"learn-capoeira\/capoeira-to-try-at-home\">au<\/a> to the center. \r\n            <\/li>\r\n\r\n            <li>\r\n                The second method is by \"buying\" the game.

To show respect to the senior capoeirista, it is not advisable to buy a game from players who are higher ranked than you. Especially from the instructor or a celebrated capoeirista. Lastly, it is recommended to buy the game from the one who has played longer.\r\n\r\n    <\/p> \r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        <strong>Ending the Game<\/strong> - Players may end the game when the Mestre has played a certain note of the berimbau as a signal to call out the players.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boy! Look at his bimba!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, referring to the male genital part of the baby.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>The Story begins with the a champion and his son<\/h2>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>Growing up as the youngest, the young Bimba would help his mother doing chores and trained with his father, a champion of Batuque, a martial art style, in Bahia.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t<p> As he was growing up, he also worked as a carpenter and served around the docks carrying heavy cargos from ships. <\/p>\r\n\t<p> He was known to be able to carry almost 120 kilograms in weight even at a young age and this was how he initially conditioned his body for upcoming training sessions with his father. He also worked as a coal-miner, carpenter, warehouse man, long horseman and horse coach conductor throughout his life.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>During the time when he was working at the docks, he met a Navigation Captain name Betinho from Estrada das Boiadas (present day Bairro da Liberdade) in Salvador.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Captain Betinho introduced the art of Capoeira to the young Bimba. He was only 12 years old when he first learned the martial art and he was hooked!<\/p>\r\n\t<p> But learning Capoeira came with other challenges. <\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Breaking free from the shackles<\/h2>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>Slavery was very prominent in the early years of Brazil. <\/p>\r\n\t<p>The slaves were not allowed any luxuries, especially the practice of fighting.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>With a potential to cause a revolution among the slaves, the wealthy owners would punish those they will catch practicing any form of martial arts amongst their slaves.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>But this only facilitated the birth of Capoeira---a clever way to train to fight.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Capoeira is a martial art style hidden in the form of rhythmic movements, similar to that of a dance.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>It was practiced mainly by the slaves with African roots throughout the regions of Brazil.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>It appeared as a harmless cultural dance-off to the eyes of the outsiders but it also helped the slaves physically and mentally train for combat.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>But even past the years of the abolition of slavery in the country by May 13th 1888, the practice of Capoeira remained a taboo.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Seen as a symbol of resistance, the First Brazilian President, Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca officially created the Codigo Penal in 1890 which contained an act that prohibited the practice of Capoeira nationwide, with severe punishment for those who will be caught violating such law.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>With this ruling by the government, the practice of Capoeira was almost eradicated from the streets of Brazil by the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.<\/p>\r\n\t<p> Despite the ban, there were still a few people who practiced the art in hiding, afraid of the punishments if they caught practicing publicly. <\/p>\r\n\t<p>The 18 year old Bimba, however, did not feel the same way and he dedicated the rest of his life to save the Art of Capoeira from extinction.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The birth of capoeira regional<\/h2>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p> Mestre Bimba and the Birth of a New Capoeira Despite the intense pressure of Capoeira still being illegal, Bimba practiced for years and even demonstrated Capoeira to the interested few, just to keep the art alive. \r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>But as it was becoming increasingly folkloric through the years, it was also losing its original fighting aspect.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Bimba realized that if he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t act right away, his beloved Capoeira would soon just be mere hushed tales in the dark.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>A man ahead of his time, Bimba envisioned a renewed Capoeira and he set out to make changes to improve the martial art style.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Drawing from his skills in traditional Capoeira from Capt Betinho, jiu-jutsu, boxing and Batuque, which he learned from his father, Bimba created an improved version of Capoeira.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>He strongly believed that with these changes, the art would no longer be referenced as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dance\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but one that can equal the martial arts of the middle and upper class men of the society.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Bimba was the first one to create a method of teaching for Capoeira to help facilitate learning because until then, apoeira was only learned by watching and participating in the roda.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>He knew that this new Capoeira would become as respectable as the other martial arts that had come to Brazil from Asia.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>This was the beginning of the development of Capoeira Regional in 1928.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Bimba brought in a training system that consolidated the other martial arts technique and refined the art.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Player of Capoeira, is someone with honor and tradition<\/h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>He also recognized that like other world martial arts, Capoeira needed a code of ethics before its reputation could be restored and it could get accepted by people outside the criminal underworld as a part of Brazilian heritage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t<h4>This honour code includes:<\/h4>\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\tNo smoking or drinking alcohol since it interferes with a player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\tSkills should only be demonstrated inside the roda, allowing for the element of surprise should a real fight situation occur.
